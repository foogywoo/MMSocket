TODO: cocoapods support

MMSocket framework provides a simple way of creating swift client and server sockets on both iOS and tvOS.

I created this simple framework for a project in which I needed to exchange some data between a tvOS app and a iOS companion app.

## Features
* iOS + tvOS support
* Pure swift
* Zero configuration support using Bonjour
* Fully asynchronous operations using GCD
* Simple protocol implementation to send various data packets like JSON
* No external dependencies

# Installation
## Cocoapods
Add this to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'MMSocket'
```
And run then `pod install`


# Code examples

## Client socket example
```swift

```

## Server socket example
